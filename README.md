# PICity  
  
The PICity is result of **Map and GPS** lesson of **Udemy iOS Developer** course.  
  
PICity is an app, that enables users to download fotos from a specific map location area.  

When the app launchs a map is displayed, and after the user double touch a specific location, the coordinates from that area are send to flickr api to retrieve photos.
